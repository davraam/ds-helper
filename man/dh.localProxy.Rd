\title{Generate a local proxy dataframe to enable local auto-completion in RStudio}
\usage{
dh.localProxy(df = NULL, conns = NULL, checks = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Character specifying a server-side data frame.}

\item{conns}{DataSHIELD connections object.}

\item{checks}{Logical; if TRUE checks are performed prior to running the
function. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
Creates a local proxy dataframe. Stops function if \code{df} doesn't exist
or contains variables with inconsistent class across cohorts.
}
\description{
If you have a remote dataframe on the servers, it can be challenging to
remember variable names when writing code. Because the dataframes are on
remote servers, auto-complete won't work in RStudio. The purpose of this
function is to create a local object that has the same structure as the
remote data frame and enables the use of autocomplete when writing DataSHIELD
code.
}
\details{
If you have a dataframe "D" with columns LAB_TSC, DIS_CVA and
DIS_DIAB, normally you would need to write:

\code{ds.summary("D$LAB_TSC")} with the variable name spelled correctly
(no autocomplete!) and remember quotation marks. However after running this
function you can type:

\verb{ds.summary(D$} and hit tab, and the list of variables will be displayed.
Choose one and hit enter to finish up with:

\code{ds.summary(D$LAB_TSC)} - no quotation marks needed either!
}
