\usage{
dh.stablisedWeights(
  glm_object = NULL,
  responder_df = NULL,
  responder_var = NULL,
  non_responder_level,
  responder_level,
  new_obj = NULL,
  conns = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{glm_object}{A fitted ds.glmSLMA object.}

\item{responder_df}{A serverside data frame containing the responder variable.}

\item{responder_var}{Character vector of outcome variable within `responder_df`.}

\item{non_responder_level}{Character vector indicating level of `responder_var` corresponding to
non-responders.}

\item{responder_level}{Character vector indicating level of `responder_var` corresponding to
responders.}

\item{new_obj}{A character string for the name of the new object to store stabilized weights.}

\item{conns}{DataSHIELD connections object.}
}
\value{
Stabilized weights assigned as serverside object `new_obj`
}
\description{
This calculates stablised inverse probability weights. Currently only works with a binary
outcome variable.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
  1. Generate predicted values from the GLM model.
  2. Calculate proportions of a binary outcome using the outcome data.
  3. Format the proportions data for analysis.
  4. Create stabilized weights using the formatted proportions and GLM predictions.
}
\note{
Currently only works with binary outcome variable.
